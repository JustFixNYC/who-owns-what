This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuration

This project comes pre-configured with sensible defaults, but
you can customize them with the following command:

```
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Now edit `.env.local` as needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Note that you also need
to be running the API server for everything to work properly, so
you might want to run `yarn start` in the parent directory
instead.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
