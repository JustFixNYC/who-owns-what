Accordingly, each time you sign in to or otherwise use the service you are entering into a new agreement with us on the then applicable terms and conditions and you agree that we may notify you of new terms by posting them on the service (or in any other reasonable manner of notice which we elect), and that your use of the service after such notice constitutes your going forward agreement to the new terms for your new use and transactions.</b> Therefore, you should review the posted Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms, each time you use the Service. Any new Terms or Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use and any specific term to which we previously committed to apply those terms (if applicable) (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page, which you agree is a reasonable manner of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services. </p>

As to any provision in these Terms, or applicable Additional Terms, that grants WhoOwnsWhat a right of consent or approval, or permits WhoOwnsWhat to exercise a right in its “sole discretion,” WhoOwnsWhat may exercise that right in its sole and absolute discretion. No WhoOwnsWhat consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by WhoOwnsWhat without being in writing and signed by an officer of WhoOwnsWhat. </p> 
          <p> Applicable Law. These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the New York, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. </p>
          <p> Severability; Interpretation. If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect). To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.
