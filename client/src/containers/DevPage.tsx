            If you're having trouble developing the app, check out the{" "}
            <a href="https://github.com/JustFixNYC/who-owns-what#readme">README</a> and{" "}

          <h2>Things to try</h2>
          <p>
            The following can be used to help develop Who Owns What and roughly constitute a manual
            test suite for the app.
          </p>
          <h3>A panoply of addresses</h3>
          <p>
            The following addresses cover a wide range of data that WoW will present to users in
            different ways. Make sure that they all behave as expected!
          </p>
          <ul>
            {ADDRESS_EXAMPLES.map((ae) => (
              <li key={ae.desc}>
                <AddressExample {...ae} />
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <h3>BBL routes</h3>
          <p>
            Who Owns What offers a BBL-based route that can be used by housing organizers and other
            websites to link to WoW if they only have a BBL. Here's an example:
          </p>
          <p>
            <Link to={fullBllUrl}>{fullBllUrl}</Link>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Page>
  );
};
