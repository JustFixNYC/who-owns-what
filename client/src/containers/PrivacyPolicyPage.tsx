            third parties. Such third party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy
            and business practices of that third party, not WhoOwnsWhat. WhoOwnsWhat may also share
            any information about you (including, without limitation, WhoOwnsWhat-Collected PI) for
            any purposes not inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, or our statements as the point

            WhoOwnsWhat to the service providers to send you direct marketing messages other than
            related to the WhoOwnsWhat absent your consent. However, third-party analytics and other

            We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and,
            therefore, you should review such third-party privacy policies and practices of such
            third parties prior to requesting information from or otherwise interacting with them.
