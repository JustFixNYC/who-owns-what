For this reason, you may see a sudden drop of registered units to zero, but this doesn’t necessarily reflect an actual loss of stabilized units. If you see a gradual decline in the number of stabilized units that is more likely to represent a true destabilization of units, especially if before 2019 when the passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA) greatly limited the ways units could be legally destabilized.
