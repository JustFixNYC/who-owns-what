oca_tables:
  # This is a list of table names we create for the OCA evictions data. Each 
  # name corresponds to a "select_*.sql" script that extracts the data from 
  # a separate DB with the private address-level OCA data, and a 
  # "create_*.sql" script that creates an empty table on the main DB
  # for WOW. In the nycdb-k8s-loader repo we automate the process
  # of running these scripts and populating the tables with each weekly
  # update of the data. These must be created before the WOW SQL scripts below.
