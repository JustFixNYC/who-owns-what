# Who owns what in nyc?

The Who owns What project is a new resource for community organizers and tenant leaders to demystify property ownership and shell company networks across New York City.

With this website, you can find crucial information about who is responsible for your building. The site utilizes a database of 160k other properties to connect the dots and discover other properties that your landlord might own or be associated with. Use this tool to discover what buildings in your neighborhood to organize in, what communities your landlord might be targeting, and if your building might be financially overleveraged.

**This project is currently in active development!**

## Architecture

This site is built on top of the critical work done by [@aepyornis](https://github.com/aepyornis) on the [nyc-db](https://github.com/aepyornis/nyc-db) project, which is used to cleanly extract, sanitize, and load [HPD Registration data](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/open-data.page) into a PostgreSQL instance.

Backend logic and data manipulation is largely handled by making calls to PostgreSQL functions and prebuilding results into tables whenever possible to avoid complex queries made per-request. See the [hpd-registration ](https://github.com/aepyornis/nyc-db/tree/master/src/nycdb/sql/hpd_registrations) scripts of `nyc-db` for the SQL code that provides this functionality.

#### Backend

The backend of the app (`/server`) is a simple express build that connects to Postgres using `pg-promise`.

#### Frontend

The frontend of the app (`/client`) is built on top of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See [`/client/README.md`](https://github.com/JustFixNYC/who-owns-what/blob/master/client/README.md) for all the info you might need.

## Setup

In order to set things up, you'll need to start with the [JustFix fork of nyc-db](https://github.com/JustFixNYC/nyc-db) running on a local Postgre instance. You'll then need to run the code in `sql` in order to build the appropriate tables and functions that the back end relies on.

After that, make sure you have node/npm/[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and then run:

```
yarn install-all
```

to grab dependencies for both server and client.

Then copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit it as needed:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

## Running in development

Check `package.json` in the root directory for all options. To run both `express` and `create-react-app` you just need:

```
yarn start
```

from root.

You can visit your local dev instance at http://localhost:3000.

## Alternative: Docker-based development

As an alternative to the aforementioned setup, you can use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Once you've
installed Docker, run:

```
docker-compose run app python dbtool.py builddb --use-test-data
```

This will build a nyc-db with test data, which is must faster
than downloading the whole nyc-db. You can, however, opt to
download the whole thing by leaving out the `--use-test-data`
argument--but be prepared, as it will take a while!

Once you've done that, run:

```
docker-compose run app yarn install-all
```

Then create an `.env` file and edit it as needed:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then start up the server:

```
docker-compose up
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and you should be good to go!

## Deploying

Package client-side assets through:

```
cd client && yarn build
```

Your express app will grab static files (i.e. the react app and assets) from `client/build` automatically.

## Cross-browser testing

We use BrowserStack Live to make sure that our sites work across browsers, operating systems, and devices.
